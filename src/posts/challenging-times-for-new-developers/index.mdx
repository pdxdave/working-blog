How times have changed for new developers trying to break into the industry. Several weeks ago a senior level developer with over 20 years of experience told me that he doesn't envy my situation at all. He reflected back to the year 2000, before the dot com bust, how crazy easy it was to get hired. “If you knew what an 'object' was, you were hired”, he said. In fact, “if you could create a simple CRUD (create, read, update, delete) app you could be looking at a $15K sign-on bonus”.

<br />

Now-a-days it's not uncommon to see entry level positions require “expert level” knowledge for a variety of technologies and/or “three or more years” of experience. Maybe we need a re-classification for the industry; for instance, “pre-entry level” opportunities. Perhaps that could whittle it down to only “one year of experience required”.

<br />

I know of many junior developers who spend their days (and often into the evenings) working on HackerRank problems. If you're not aware of HackerRank, it's an on-line site that offers a variety of technical assessment tests; for instance, Angular, ReactJs, Python, etc. Suffice it to say HackerRank covers a lot of ground. They pour over problems in the off chance they're asked to whiteboard a solution to figure out how many triangles of a given size will fit into a rectangle of a given size. The likelihood of this ever happening on the job is slim at best though. Still, they spend many hours working on these problems because they want to be prepared...just in case. As for me, I don't. I like to build stuff with the little precious time I have to spend at my computer. Maybe this makes me an at risk candidate, I don't know.  In fairness, I also know they're working on time complexity problems, efficient ways to sift through data, etc.

<br />

This is not to suggest all is doom and gloom though. For example, this same senior developer doesn't incorporate whiteboard exams into his interview process. Interview problems, both on-site and take home exams, only cover what the candidate can expect to experience on the job. What a novel idea. He must be a renegade in the industry.
