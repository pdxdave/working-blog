As a former software developer recruiter, I know the importance of developing solid interviewing skills.  And Like anything in life, to get good at something you have to research and practice. Those who know me have heard me say this many times. Here's a book that can help you along the way to becoming a Ninja interviewee.

Andrew Lacivita has recruited for many years.  He's an author, career coach trainer, blogger, speaker and [YouTuber](https://www.youtube.com/candylacivita/featured).  His book, [Interview Intervention](https://www.amazon.com/Interview-Intervention-Communication-milewalk-Business/dp/1452547025/ref=sr_1_1?crid=23XL72IVT4H9H&dchild=1&keywords=interview+intervention+andrew+lacivita&qid=1604023843&sprefix=interview+inter%2Caps%2C570&sr=8-1), helps candidates prepare for the interview process. Lacivita covers a lot of ground; for instance, how to align the lifestyle you want with an opportunity that reflects that lifestyle; how to answer common, yet challenging questions; how to make sure communication is clear on both sides of the table; how to be a candidate they'll remember (for all the right reasons); and, how to make sure you're making the right decision to move forward or decline an offer.

Books like this are interesting to me because much of the information seems so common sense (and for this reason many people overlook these kinds of books).  Yet, in spite of that, I can recount numerous times I've seen intelligent, talented software developers bomb their soft skills interviews because, well...they were clueless.  They thought a dazzling whiteboard solution was enough to win the day.  I hate to be the bearer of bad news, but that's not true. 

In the chapter "Friending" the Interviewer, Lacivita writes, "People buy from who they like. They hire who they like". Based on my years of recruiting, I am in total agreement.  Think of it this way.  In software development it's not uncommon, from time-to-time, to burn the midnight oil for days or even weeks at a time on a project.  For instance, a friend of mine recently had a 56 hour week, followed by a 65 and then a 90.  He was with his co-workers a lot. Being around people you like and can get along with under such circumstances is incredibly important. As an interviewee, it's your job to present yourself as that person. Lacivita offers solid suggestions and examples to help you do so.  

Overall I recommend this book.  You will come away with a number of actionable tips to help you in your interview journey.  On occasion Lacivita will have free copies available on his YouTube site via a link in the notes section.  All you pay for is shipping.  Check it out. In the event he doesn't, it's still worth the $12 on Amazon.
