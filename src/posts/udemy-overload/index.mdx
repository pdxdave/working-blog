The other day I received an email regarding some new Udemy courses.  I hadn’t look at a course in a while, so I jumped on to my Udemy account to see what I’ve purchased.  As I went through the courses I noticed a trend.
Most if not all of them had not been completed.  It’s not that I’ve been lazy, but rather I’ve been sidetracked by articles, videos or projects that I’ve wanted to work on.
