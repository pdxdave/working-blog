The other day I received an email regarding newly released Udemy courses.  I hadn’t been to Udemy in a while, so I jumped on and reviewed the courses I had purchased.  As I went through them I noticed a trend.
Most had not been completed.  It’s not that I’ve been lazy, but rather I’ve been sidetracked 
by other articles, videos or projects that I’ve wanted to work on.

I suspected there might be some hidden gems of information within those videos though, so I fired 
up a Trello board and mapped out a plan of attack to finish "a" course. I was right.  So far there
have been a few gems, or at the very least a different take on approaching a solution to a problem.
I expect it will take me a couple of days to get through this course, and I have something like 9
otheres in waiting.
