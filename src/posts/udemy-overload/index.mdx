The other day I received an email regarding newly released Udemy courses.  I hadn’t been to Udemy in a while, so I jumped on and reviewed the courses I’ve purchased.  As I went through them I noticed a trend.
Most had not been completed.  It’s not that I’ve been lazy, but rather I’ve been sidetracked 
by other articles, videos or projects that I’ve wanted to work on.
