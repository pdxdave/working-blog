I recently had the pleasure of talking with John Soulakis, Engineering Manager at New Relic in Portland, OR. If you're not familiar with New Relic, you should be. New Relic started in 2008 in San Francisco. They are a software as a service company that monitors Web and mobile applications in real-time with support for custom-built plugins to collect data. In 2020 New Relic had revenues of $600 million and as of this moment have offices in the US, Australia, France, Germany, Ireland, Israel, Japan, Singapore, Spain,Switzerland and the UK.

Q: How about we start with a little bit about your background.

John:  I've been in software engineering for quite a bit of my career.  I started out as an installer of software. My first job out of college I was hired to install software and train users how to use software that was targeted toward the hospitality industry. Within that company I moved into a QA role. I was self-taught.  I was curious.  I just didn't want to find bugs I wanted to figure out why things were breaking and fix them. So I taught myself how to code thanks to some generous more senior software engineers.  That company was small enough and I was fortunate enough for them to take a chance on my lack of experience and that allowed me to move over to a software engineering role. So then I progressed from being a entry-level software engineer to a senior software engineer.  I moved jobs a couple of times because I had moved. I worked as a senior software engineer doing web development for a while for an agency and then I went to Nike for like eight years. That's where I got into management, managing software teams. I ended up leaving Nike because my wife and I actually took a year off and we traveled. We road tripped around the US for a year, or a little bit over a year. Fortunately the timing was great because we got back six months before COVID-19 hit.  So we got kind of lucky there. And then I joined New Relic about six months ago as a software engineering manager.


Q: My blog is geared toward junior developers. In particular, those trying to get their first development job. Many times I'll read posts on LinkedIn or various slack channels from junior devs who are trying to cover as many bases as possible. For instance, they're trying to learn Go, Dart, Java, Angular, R, Python, etc., all at the same time to try to meet the variety of skills listed in entry level jobs. What are you thoughts on this approach?

John: If you're really really smart and have a lot of time and creativity, then I guess that approach could work. As a software engineering manager, I would be somewhat concerned about someone who has that much on their resume because they would have very little depth in any of those things.  And so, I'm not saying they couldn't do more than "Hello World", but not enough to understand how those languages work. My preference would be that as a hiring manager I'd look for someone who actually had like side-load experience, and even if it was in a technology that wasn't 100% relevant to what we were doing.  But then also had some limited experience with other technologies like...to me that approach says a couple of things.  They're super curious, which is great. That's actually a positive because they're willing to learn about a bunch of different technologies. I like that part.  But they probably don't have a good understanding of how the language works...and for any of those because it's so broad. Maybe two or three languages and they said "I do most of my work in Node or Javascript, but I've played around in Go. I've played around in Python". I think that to me would be something I would look more favorably upon at an entry level.  Just because it shows that they understand how to code in a language, but they're super curious about learning new technologies and new languages.  


Q: Generally speaking, what skills do you think junior developers are lacking? Where do you see room for improvement?

John: I think the biggest thing is coming into places that have developed processes. It's something they don't teach in school. For instance, I had an intern this Summer.  Super super smart, but they never had exposure in their class work around build tools, how to do build jobs.  So...like using Jenkins and these other tools that aren't just coding but are a big part of what a software engineer is expected to do. Even limited experience or knowledge of unit testing and integration tests and frameworks that are used to do those things. I think those are areas that they don't necessarily teach in school or at least not in what I've seen. It's something that almost every engineering job expects candidates to know. For an entry level I'm not expecting them to know all those things, but knowing the concepts is a bonus. But I think the gaps are around those real world things that we expect, especially as we move into CICD and those types of like...constantly deploying code.  It's just that tooling is something engineers are just expected to know and understand these days. It's not really taught.  It's on the job learning. So, I think that's a big gap that I see.  It's also one though if you're willing to learn it's easy to overcome.

Q: During the interview process, what kinds of questions do you like to hear from junior developers?

John: The questions I would love to hear...questions on what we provide for mentorship and helping them become successful. Asking about pair programming.  Do our teams like to pair on work that they're doing.  Are there internal resource groups or internal resource practices that they can turn to if they have questions about things.  What are the things we're doing to help them become successful in their job. I think sometimes when junior engineers apply for jobs they feel like they should know all the answers and are nervous about not knowing the answers. I'd much rather someone say I don't have a lot of experience in that area.  I want to learn about it.  I'm interested in it.  I would love to be able to pair with a more senior engineer and learn more, than a junior engineer pretending to know more about a topic and they're unsure about it.  The questions I would like to hear about are about the team.  How does the team help each other.


Q: Portfolio projects are also an area of concern for junior developers; for instance, what should I make? When you look at junior portfolio projects, what are you looking for?

John: I think the biggest thing that I would look for is structure.  How they're approaching a problem.  How they're structuring things. Are they putting good comments in their code so someone who is reading their code can understand it. So I don't know that they have to have some crazy big portfolio project that's super complicated, has all the bells and whistles.  I would look more for how did they organize their project.  Did they think about it before they started coding. Do they have readability, and how easy would it be for someone else to come in and make changes or pick up the code they created.  Those are big things that are hard to teach. Those things would stand out to me as a candidate being a good candidate because...like the complexity and the knowledge if they're smart...you can tell that they're smart from the work that they do or from having a conversation.  You can tell that they're curious.  That they're interested in learning.  I'm not as concerned about how deep their knowledge is in a topic. Those are things they can learn and pick up on the job. How to write code that is easy to maintain for people to pick up and work on.  That's something that takes a lot more time and experience to learn. Is their repo laid out well and organized well. Those are bigger indicators of success than having someone who has some super complicated...that like their project does something super complicated.  That's great, but if the code is spaghetti and is hard to read and follow, not organized well...I'd have more concerns. 

The project also has a lot to do with the area you're looking to get hired in. Now-a-days you can either be as specialized or as broad as you want. You could have a project that's just front-end. For instance, React.  It could be super complicated, but it shows that you know front-end work. I've managed full-stack, back-end, Java based services, and now my teams are mostly front-end teams. For me the project is what the position is about. It's less about having some massive project that shows everything, but if you're applying for a UI or front-end position having a project that shows you know the current stuff, tooling, etc. To build that project goes a long way. The same goes for back-end. For instance, if you've written an API or micro-services that does some complicated stuff, the front-end doesn't matter so much because you're applying for a back-end position. Now if I'm hiring for a full-stack engineer, then something that has some back-end services, an API and a front-end showing that you are able to code in all those areas.  Again, if it's for a junior developer it doesn't have to be super complicated. Show that you have some knowledge.  We don't expect you to be an expert.

Q: Github. The mantra amongst junior devs is that Github must remain green at all costs. A white square is a day of shame. Is Github activity a measurement for employment? Do you have any thoughts on that?

John: For me, it's not something that I look at. I don't know if it's something the talent acquisition people look and see. I think it's great that people are active, contributing to things and are pushing code. But I don't know if I'm going to use that as a metric. I'm more concerned about what the code is you've done versus having..."oh so every day you're committing code", but if it's terrible code that's going to take a lot of unlearning then that's not going to benefit anybody. For me it's not a big deal.  I don't know about...I've never look at that. I've more looked at...when I've hired I've had tech leads look at code, but I don't think they've ever come back and said, "oh they haven't been active in three weeks,  we should not consider them".  That's never been a consideration. 


Q: Not everyone matches a job description 100%. Generally speaking, if you had to pick a percentage match for a junior dev to apply for an opportunity, what would that percentage be?

John: Fifty percent is great I think.  And for me, again...I am less concerned about meeting every single little requirement with a junior dev.  If it's a senior dev or tech lead, then yes there are boxes that have to be checked off.  But for a junior dev I'm looking for do they have some experience, do they know a langauge, are they comfortable in a dev environment, do they seem curious, do they seem like they're wanting to learn, do they know that they don't know everything, are are they excited about having the chance to learn?  For me that goes a lot further than a resume that checks all the boxes. And I think that's the really hard part about being a junior dev.  Depending on the company, and I've worked for companies that are 20 people where the hiring managers are literally the ones getting the emails, sorting through resumes, and they get to pick who they interview without anyone else...like I worked at Nike with ten thousand people, and there's a very formal process for how to apply.  I mean, I just can't pull a resume.  People can't email me directly.  They have to go through talent acquisition folks and so I think that can be a barrier. It can be hard time for a junior dev to get their resume to a hiring manager. Depending how the talent acquisition team or recruiter are working they may need to have a certain number of boxes checked off on the resume. It is a bit of catch 22 because I can understand how some of those resumes never make it to my desk because they don't check certain boxes. When I'm hiring for a junior dev, I try to make it clear that I try to limit the number of "required" skills and experience, then have that list of "great" or a "bonus" if you have this. It makes it more expansive so I get more resumes.  From somebody who came in and got their start in software engineering, no formal training, took a couple classes in high school and college, but otherwise just because I was curious and wanted to learn, was willing to put in the time to become a software engineer.  I'm not looking for this perfect candidate for a junior that's going to walk in and know everything.  If you're hiring that person for a junior dev then that would actually set off red flags: why are they applying for a junior position?

Q: There's a lot of talk amongst junior developers regarding whiteboard challenges; for instance, the fear of having to traverse a doubly-linked list. For this reason many spend countless hours going over HackRank and LeetCode problems. The prevailing thought is that if one can't provide a solution during a whiteboard exam, it's game over. Any thoughts on spending a lot of time working out these problems and the all or nothing mind set regarding whiteboard questions?

John: I think the mindset is more of a problem. I mean...I don't think there's anything wrong with spending time on those problems. It's not going to hurt. I wouldn't obsess over it if just getting started. The more of those types of white board questions they have exposure to probably the better. That being said, the mindset of "If I don't get this...I don't nail this whiteboard exercise, it's over" is...that's a hard one. I would encourage anyone who is applying not to have that mindset. What I'm really looking for when we do whiteboard problems is their approach to problem solving. How do they think? How do they tackle a problem?  Are they just diving right in and trying to write pseudo code or actual code depending on the question, or do they take a step back and try to understand all the requirements, see what they're thinking about, their approach and then start working through it?  To me that's a lot more of an indicator even if they get the wrong answer, or don't complete it successfully. The fact that they know how to problem solve or approach a problem.  I'll take a lot more away from that than if they just came in and in two seconds had the problem solved. That may just indicate that they've seen the problem before. The most successful software engineers are problem solvers. How do you solve that business problem? How are you developing that thing that's going to provide value to the client? A junior engineer that takes a thoughtful approach will score higher with me than someone who just comes in and gets it.
